**Purpose**</br>
As a group we decided to work on this particular topic since we have seen a lot of issuses regarding workouts of different gym goers. Many of them resort on using different articles and searching on the Web for "The best workout plan" and usually they get dissapointed or pay lots of money to just access a website. We want to change that, by creating a software which will generate a plan based on answers and the user preferences. In addition, it will allow the user to check every exercise online, so the user better knows how to perform that exercise. 

**Objectives**
1. To provide users a well-structered website 
2. To fullfil the user's needs
3. To reduce risk of injuries from poor form
4. To maximize gains
5. To educate the users on how important proper training is

**Target audience**</br>
Fitness enthusiasts, people that want to improve their physical health, overweight people, people that want to gain muscles.


<h2>Development Model</h2>
The development model we will be using to construct our applications is going to be the Waterfall Model. We have chosen this type of model since is divided into phases and everything has to be done step by step, from the implementation to the testing of the application. Also, we have a clear vision of the customer needs, which allows us to cover a lot of aspects without the need of drastic changes in the future.

<h2>User Requirements</h2>
For the user requirements we have decided that hte application needs:

1. A Homepage</br>
2. A Login/Sign In page where the user creates their own profile</br>
3. MyProfile page, where the user can customize his account and set goals based on their preferences</br>
4. A feedback page, where feedback is sent to us regarding improvements</br>
5. A Customer support page where the user can contact us regarding issues</br>
6. A Form page, where the customer can evaluate themselves and get their results.</br>

The user shall be able to enter the Homepage, whith the choice to Sign in or to go directly to the Form page. Based on the answers the system will generate the appropriate workout plan, whith links to each exercise for extra instructions.
