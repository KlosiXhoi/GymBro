**Purpose**</br>
As a group we decided to work on this particular topic since we have seen a lot of issuses regarding workouts of different gym goers. Many of them resort on using different articles and searching on the Web for "The best workout plan" and usually they get dissapointed or pay lots of money to just access a website. We want to change that, by creating a software which will generate a plan based on answers and the user preferences. In addition, it will allow the user to check every exercise online, so the user better knows how to perform that exercise. 

**Objectives**
1. To provide users a well-structered website 
2. To fullfil the user's needs
3. To reduce risk of injuries from poor form
4. To maximize gains
5. To educate the users on how important proper training is

**Target audience**</br>
Fitness enthusiasts, people that want to improve their physical health, overweight people, people that want to gain muscles.
