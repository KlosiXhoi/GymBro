        <title>7 Day split for losing weight</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>This is your workout based on your preferences </h2>
        <p>To lose weight, means that you need to burn more calories that you intake. A great way to do this is to walk/run a lot.
            Before every weightlifting workout do at least 15 minutes of treadmill or bicycle machine. You can use your prefered settings, but here is a recommended treadmill exercise: 
            15 minutes on 5.6 km/h on 15 incline</p>
        <p>Now lets talk about your weightlifting workout. For a 7 day workout plan, we reccomend 1 active rest day. What is that you ask? Well, during that day you can go for a walk, jog or even play your favorite sport.
            For the other 6 days, you will be hitting different muscle groups on each day. We recommend 2 workout plans: the simple push, pull, legs (PPL), which you are going to do twice per week, or the workout explained below.</p>
